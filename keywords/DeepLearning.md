 ##DeepLearning 

The term “deep Learning” refers to the idea of Artificial intelligence teaching machine learning operators to “think” and “behave” in ways a human would.
 Deep learning uses multiple layers of algorithms to create an AI that can learn complex tasks and solve complex problems. AI has become more accurate and efficient due to this powerful form of machine learning. Machine Learning, Pattern Recognition, and Deep Learning have all been revolutionized by Deep Learning. 
Researchers have been using Deep Learning to identify potential new antibiotics with greater accuracy and efficiency than they've been using traditional methods in the detection of antibiotics. This technology has the potential to revolutionize the way antibiotics are discovered and developed.
