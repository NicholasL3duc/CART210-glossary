# Internet of things I.O.T


The Internet of Things also known as “I.O.T” is a system of interrelated devices connected to the Internet. In layman's terms, through the use of a smartphone, you can turn on or off your AC, television and even your Car, the interconnected aspect of the devices is the Internet of things.
Within the IoT, devices are divided into two categories, General devices are the main component of the data hub, examples of this include home appliances and anything with a wifi receiver. On the other hand, we have Sensing devices, these devices measure sound, temperature and light. 
	The main focus on advancements in IOT is simply to “ lessen the burden on Humans”, with smart devices found in every walk of life, the demand for more seem to be endless. 

### What Technologies have made IOT possible?

There are a number of factors that have helped the birth of IOT, but some are more notable than others. 
Simple sensors have opened doors to IOT development in helping gardeners know when their plants need to be watered based on soil moisture and/or starting their car off of their phone on a cold winter day.
	Machine Learning allows IOT devices to gather information faster and learn to benefit the user based on their daily pattern.
AI such as Siri and Alexa use IOT to cater to its user's comfort, such as asking to play a song on the speaker or placing calendar events on multiple devices.


### How can IOT help the Economy?

The increasing use of IOT connects users around the world, building a database that would cut time on crucial necessities such as; a Smart power grid which would know when usage is at an all-time high or when to distribute power at an efficient use. 
Smart Manufacturing is another example of IOT use, having an interconnected workforce on complex designs such as medical machinery or automobile manufacturers gives little to no room for error ( apart from Human mistakes).
